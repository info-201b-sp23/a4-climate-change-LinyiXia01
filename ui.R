      We only have one Earth on which we rely for survival, it's crucial to pay attention to the issue of climate change.
      And CO2 emission is a substantial contributor to climate change.
      Therefore, this report, using data from Our World In Data, focuses on two variables:
      the annual total CO2 emissions and the annual production-based CO2 emissions from cement, coal, flaring, gas, and oil.
      The aim is to understand how and where CO2 emissions are primarily generated and how this pattern has evolved over time.
      Hope this report can help people have a better comprehension of the factors influencing CO2 emissions and
      thus make effective climate change mitigation strategies."),

      While for some developed countries and regions such as the US and the EU, the data spans a much longer period of time.
      Without further information, it is unclear whether this gap is due to missing data or some other reasons.
